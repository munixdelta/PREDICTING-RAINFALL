# 🌧️ Rain Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Question:

**Build a model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow using classification algorithms and weather data.**

---

## 🧠 Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts **"RainTomorrow"** (Yes/No) based on various weather-related features using real-world historical weather data.

---

## 📂 Dataset Used

* **Name:** `weatherAUS.csv`
* **Source:** Australian weather dataset containing daily weather observations from major weather stations.
* **Target Column:** `RainTomorrow` (Yes/No)
* **Features include:**

  * Temperature, Rainfall, Wind speed
  * Humidity, Pressure, Visibility
  * Wind Direction, etc.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries Used:**

  * `pandas` — data handling
  * `numpy` — numerical operations
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — data visualization
  * `sklearn` — machine learning (modeling, preprocessing, evaluation)
  * `joblib` — model saving

---

## 🧽 Data Preprocessing

1. **Remove unnecessary or highly missing columns:** e.g., `Evaporation`, `Sunshine`, etc.
2. **Handle missing values:**

   * Numeric: filled using **mean**
   * Categorical: filled using **mode**
3. **Encode categorical variables** using `LabelEncoder`
4. **Train-test split** (80% training, 20% testing)
5. **Feature scaling** is applied where needed

---

## 🤖 Algorithm Used

* ✅ **Random Forest Classifier**

> Reason: It is powerful for classification tasks, handles missing values and categorical data well, and avoids overfitting due to its ensemble nature.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* **Accuracy**
* **Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)**
* **Confusion Matrix**
* **Feature Importance Plot**

---

## 📈 Results

* The Random Forest model was able to achieve **high accuracy** in predicting rainfall.
* The most important features included: `Humidity3pm`, `RainToday`, `Pressure9am`, etc.

---

## 💾 Output

* Trained model saved as: `rain_prediction_model.pkl`
* Encoders saved as: `label_encoders.pkl`

---

## 📝 How to Run

1. Upload `weatherAUS.csv` file in Google Colab
2. Run all cells in the notebook (`Suraj_kumar_202401100300256_CSEAI_D.ipynb`)
3. The model will be trained and evaluated automatically
4. Outputs: Evaluation results, plots, and saved model files
